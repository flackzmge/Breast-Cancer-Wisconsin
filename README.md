# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin

This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to perform data analysis and visualization using R. The dataset contains information on breast cancer tumors, including their size, shape, and other characteristics.

# Preprocessing

The first step in the project is to preprocess the data. This involves cleaning the data, removing any missing or incomplete entries, and transforming the data into a form that is suitable for use with a machine learning algorithm.

# Cross-validation

Once the data has been preprocessed, we use a 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm on the dataset. This involves splitting the dataset into 10 subsets, training a model on 9 of the subsets, and then evaluating the model on the remaining subset. This process is repeated 10 times, with each subset serving as the test set once. The final model performance is then averaged across all 10 iterations.

# Prediction

Using the results of the cross-validation, we can predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. We can also compare the performance of different algorithms and identify the one that is best suited for the task.
